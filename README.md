During my Ph.D. study, I have polished and demonstrated my high-level research capability, strong analytical and problem-solving skills through several research topics: 1) exploiting to characterize and model temporal trends in a large social-media network using big data techniques, 2) optimizing the performance and scalability of big data systems using program analysis and machine learning techniques, 3) detecting and repairing programming errors automatically leveraging deep learning techniques. Before my Ph.D. the roles of a Linux kernel developer in MacroSAN and a director of the IT department in Elivebuy give me an opportunity to enhance my industrial and management work experience. Specifically, I not only have extensive experience using Python, Scala and R to design and develop multiple Apache Spark and learning-based applications, but also have strong computer skills including Linux system management, MySQL, AWS, and Jupyter notebook.
